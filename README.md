# Airtable to Excel

An experimental project attempting to recreate the basic functionalities of a relational database (such as Airtable's linked records, lookup fields, etc) solely using formulas available in spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Sheets.

This may be useful for states or dynamic data-based projects that need the basic functionality of a software like Airtable with large record sizes that surpass the viability of Airtable's pricing model.
